# Complexity vs. Accuracy  
**On Mechanistic Interpretability's Dependence on the Linear Representation Hypothesis**

## Files

The newest code I use can be found in /Version_3.2__Early_Stopping_Neural_Net_Phi/DAS_V3.2.ipynb (this is also the only cleaned up code). However be aware that this code is implemented with early-stopping. Each folder has further results_*.json files. This include the results for a specific setting in the DAS paper (defined in name). Each such file includes the results for up to 10 different runs using different random seeds.
