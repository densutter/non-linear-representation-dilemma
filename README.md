# Complexity vs. Accuracy  
**On Mechanistic Interpretability's Dependence on the Linear Representation Hypothesis**

## Files

The newest code I use can be found in DAS\_Experiment\_V5.5\_Cleanup. The Experiments are as following:

+ DAS\_Own\_Code\_V5\_Standard\_DAS.ipynb: Runs the standard full DAS run on MLPs (with different transformation functions)
+ DAS\_Own\_Code\_V5\_Training\_Progression.ipynb: Runs the DAS experiments at different MLP training stages (with different transformation functions)
+ DAS\_Own\_Code\_V5\_Hidden\_Size\_Progression.ipynb: Runs the DAS experiments with different hidden layer size RevNets on MLPs
+ DAS\_Own\_Code\_V5\_LLM\_Experiments.ipynb: Runs the standard full DAS run on LLMs (with different transformation functions)
